# Strafe-WWII-v1.1

v1.1

This is a plane wave shooter game.

To play the game open the executable i.e. the file with the '.exe.' extension.

IMPORTANT
This executable must be kept within the same file directory as the 'Assets' folder.
Otherwise when opening the executable you will receive a nasty error message.

Known bugs:
Bullets spawn from inside the planes wings - not gamae breaking

Enjoy!
